	<h1>Hey, I'm Shane.</h1>
	<h2>I'm a hobbyist full-stack web developer working on personal projects to strengthen my coding proficiency and
		provide useful services for online communities.</h2>
	<p>
		I spend most of my free time designing and developing websites, but I also work on back-end applications as well.
		My
		most popular project is <a href="https://modrunner.net">Modrunner</a>, a Discord bot that provides useful services
		for Minecraft modding communities on Discord.
	</p>
	<p>
		My tech stack and known languages list is relatively small at the moment, but I'm always interested in broadening
		my
		horizons
		to learn new technologies, frameworks or languages. Currently my preferred stack includes <a
			href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript">JavaScript</a>
		paired with
		<a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> for the front-end, <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> for the
		back-end, or <a href="https://nuxt.com/">Nuxt</a> for both! I also work with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
		and <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>
		for smaller, statically-generated sites like this one. I have a certification for <a
			href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>
		and I'm working on learning <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> and <a
			href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>. I'm also experimenting with <a
			href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> and <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> to
		delve a little into mobile app development!

	<!-- <p>
		Once in a while I also write <a href="/blog">blog posts</a> about my programming journey. Feel free to browse
		through, maybe you'll
		find
		them interesting!
