Hello, my name is beansquared and this is my blog.

I've never run my own blog before and I'm honestly still not really sure if I really want to. So consider this blog experimental, I really only intend on posting to here if I'm feeling like it.

If I do post here, expect it to be mostly aimless rambling about whatever I happened to be thinking about at the time. This rambling may or may not be related to any of the various [projects](/projects/) I work on.

Let's see, how can I make this post longer and make it seem more relevant (or something)?

Fuck it
