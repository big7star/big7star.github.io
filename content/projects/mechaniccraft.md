Introduction

Do you think you have what it takes...
...to survive on an uncharted hostile alien planet?



Welcome to MechanicCraft: your next modded experience that will push the boundaries of what you thought you were capable of. Experience life upon planet XC-4392, an uncharted Earth-like planet located light-years away from the nearest inhabited star-system. You were never meant to be here, yet here you are. Hostiles are on the horizon, the cold winter wind chills you to the bone. What will you do? Will you let this world break you...or will you overcome it?



Fear not, for you have powerful tools at your disposal: a strong knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems, and how to construct useful machines to aid in your survival. The only question is, can you find the resources required to complete what you need to construct to last through the winter? Or will you succumb to one of the many dangers presented by this planet's insufferable environment?


Description

MechanicCraft is at its core, a tech modpack. But this far from the only thing it has to offer.


Explore

Even with all its dangers, XC-4392 does not disappoint in its beauty and richness of its rolling landscapes. Climb the highest mountains, spelunk in the deepest caves and all of it is for you to exploit. Mine exotic minerals and ores to fabricate advanced equipment. Gather unidentified plants and animals to aid in your understanding of the world and to help fill your stomach with nutritious sustenance.
