			<h2>Discord</h2>
			<p>
				If you want/need to reach me for any reason, the best way is to message me on Discord, 
				as I'm online for the majority of the day and Discord is one of the few places I will 
				accept random friend requests. You can either send me a DM by sending me a friend 
				request or by joining my personal server that I run and sending me a message there.

				I'm not particularly active on Twitter but you can also DM me there and I'll probably respond fairly quickly.

				For more formal inquiries I can be reached by email at the below address. If you do email 
				me please do your best to make it seem like an actual person sent it (proper subject line, 
				spelling, grammar etc) otherwise I'm likely to just delete it.
