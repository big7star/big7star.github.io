Will you let this world break you&mldr;or will you overcome it?</p><p>Fear not, for you have powerful tools at your disposal: a strong knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems, and how to construct useful machines to aid in your survival.

Or will you succumb to one of the many dangers presented by this planet&rsquo;s insufferable environment?</p><p>Description</p><p>MechanicCraft is at its core, a tech modpack. But this far from the only thing it has to offer.</p><p>Explore</p><p>Even with all its dangers, XC-4392 does not disappoint in its beauty and richness of its rolling landscapes.
